    "Definition": "In this task, you're given a statement, the genre to which that statement belongs, and a label indicating if the statement should be agreed with (entailment), disagreed with (contradiction), or neither (neutral). Your job is to write a sentence that describes the genre that follows the tone with respect to the statement, as indicated by the label. The sentence must also belong to the genre specified.",
    "Positive Examples": [
        {
            "input": "Statement: Next to the MGM Grand you will find M and M World. Label: neutral. Genre: travel.",
            "output": "The candy has many fans who love its attractions.",
            "explanation": "The places are specifically pointed out and referred to as attractions and hence are in the same genre. We don't know if the candy has many fans, hence the sentence is neutral."

            "input": "Statement: I've forgotten his name now, confessed Tuppence. Label: neutral. Genre: fiction.",
            "output": "Tuppence remembered his name later.",
            "explanation": "Both sentences describe the actions of a character and hence are in the genre fiction. Tuppence may or may not remember the name later, hence the sentence is neutral."

            "explanation": "The sentences sound like they are part of a government survey report, hence the genre is government. However, it is not known if 0.25 of all households was considered a large number at the time, hence the label is neutral. So the generated answer is incorrect."
